# Introduction

This is an initiative started by [simplemap.io](https://simplemap.io) to establish an inclusive community of AI researchers for the development and exchange of best practices for AI in thermographic imaging.

A part of our workload is dedicated to open source and side projects. Almost every new package arises from client work. When we discover functionality in client projects that is useful for others, we extract it to an open source package.

You can spot team members in user groups or as conference speakers as well.


## Nice to meet you! Let us tell you who we are.

Founded in 2016 and previously with the name Rentadrone.cl we are a Chile based company that pioneered the use of drones to detect anomalies in solar panels in the Atacama Desert,
the most amazing place for solar energy generation. Rentadrone was twice backed by UNICEF Innovation Fund, where we were capable to develop open-source software to improve our internal
processes and become chilean market leaders in the photovoltaic industry among all its phases. Engineering, Construction and Operation.

## Meet our Fantastic Team

Proudly Geeks! Weâ€™re a group of engineers making Artificial Intelligence work for us.
